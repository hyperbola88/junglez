# Junglez
- A fun pet-project to practice modern CSS!
- A single-page web app for plant lovers.
- Live-demo at: https://hyperbola88.github.io/junglez/

## Technologies Used
Here I use advanced modern CSS features, such as:
- SASS
- mixins
- functions
- variables
- scalable responsive design
- animations

## Features
- All element animations are made by pure CSS, wich makes performance faster, more responsive and more cross-browser compitable
- SASS allows to nest styles, which makes the code more organized and easier to read, saves lots of time
- Using variables and functions in SASS makes it easier to maintain stylesheets and update it for differrent screen sizes


## Usage
It is a sandbox to practice modern CSS and design ideas:)

## Project Status
